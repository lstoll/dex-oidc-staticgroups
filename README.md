# dex-oidc-staticgroups

This is a version of [dex](https://github.com/coreos/dex) that has a connector that builds on the default OIDC connector, allowing groups to be mapped to users via a static mapping file.

This allows it to be used with say, public google accounts but restrict who has access and assign users to groups.


## Configuration/Deployment

A docker image is made available at [TODO](TODO)
